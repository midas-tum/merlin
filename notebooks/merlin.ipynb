    "### Synopsis\n",
    "Open-source Machine Enhanced Reconstruction Learning and Interpretation Networks (MERLIN) framework complementing frameworks such as Tensorflow and Pytorch with high-dimensional, complex-valued, and MR-specific operators, layers and data pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target audience\n",
    "Researchers and developers in the area of machine learning for medical image reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) methods have evolved tremendously during the last decade. In medical imaging, Artificial\n",
    "Intelligence and its subclass ML have the potential to impact all stages of the imaging pipeline, from (1) image\n",
    "acquisition and reconstruction to (2) image analysis and interpretation and (3) diagnosis and prognosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist a number of frameworks, which support the development and production of ML applications [1,2], also\n",
    "specifically targeted to MRI [3]. These frameworks take care of core functionalities, automatic differentiation, have\n",
    "CPU/GPU support, provide the user with a numerous amount of tools to process data, build models, and train/evaluate the\n",
    "models to make the start into ML easier. The two most prominent ones are Tensorflow [1] and Pytorch [2]. While both\n",
    "frameworks now support complex numbers (Tensorflow $\\geq$ v1.0, Pytorch $\\geq$ v1.9), support for complex-valued\n",
    "operations, complex-valued network layers [4] and MR-specific operations/layers, e.g. data consistency for MR image\n",
    "reconstruction, are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, data loading pipelines are an essential and integral part of the development. Pipelines are usually\n",
    "specific to the underlying data source, layout, application and selected ML framework. Some efforts have been made to\n",
    "unify processing in training and testing such as NiftyNet [5] for Tensorflow or TorchIO [6] for PyTorch, but each\n",
    "providing unique set of operations that are not directly applicable for high-dimensional complex-valued MR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose a framework, named Machine Enhanced Reconstruction Learning and Interpretation Networks (MERLIN), that\n",
    "seamlessly integrates with existing Tensorflow/Pytorch implementations and extends these libraries by complex-valued\n",
    "operations. Furthermore, common data pre-processing and data loader functions are provided in Python that complement\n",
    "existing data pipelines, and allows us to use the same data loader transformations independent of the underlying ML\n",
    "framework. MERLIN provides functionalities to process static (2D, 3D) and dynamic (2D+time, 3D+time) data. We also\n",
    "provide a basic tutorial for getting started on ML-based image reconstruction using complex-valued operations together\n",
    "with a documentation how the modules can be extended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionalities\n",
    "The proposed MERLIN package is comprised of three modules:\n",
    "- `merlinth`: pure Python functions\n",
    "- `merlintf`: Tensorflow/Keras functions\n",
    "- `merlinth`: Pytorch functions\n",
    "\n",
    "These modules integrate with the existing Tensorflow/Pytorch backends and provide similar interfaces. For example, a\n",
    "real-valued 2D convolution filter from Tensorflow/Keras (`tf.keras.layers.Conv2D`) can be replaced with the\n",
    "complex-valued 2D convolution filter from MERLIN (`merlintf.keras.layers.ComplexConv2D`). Fast and efficient\n",
    "implementations are written as operators in C++/CUDA. The optox framework (forked from https://github.com/VLOGroup/optox)\n",
    "is used to generate additional wrappers, e.g., complex magnitude pooling, for languages such as Python and ML libraries\n",
    "such as Tensorflow or Pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MERLIN framework provides:\n",
    "![](fig/MERLIN_overview.png)\n",
    "- MR-specific data pre-processing: normalization, coil sensitivity map estimation, coil map compression [3], ...\n",
    "- Data undersampling: variable-density Poisson Disc, Gaussian, VISTA [7] ...\n",
    "- Data processing pipelines which can be used for Tensorfow and Pytorch and in combination with other data pipelines (NiftyNet [5], TorchIO [6], ...)\n",
    "- Handling of complex operations\n",
    "- Handling of multi-dimensional data: 2D, 2Dt, 3D, 3Dt\n",
    "- Easy switching between complex-valued, 2-channel real-valued or real-valued processing\n",
    "- Complex layers for convolution, normalization, pooling, activation, ...\n",
    "- Data consistency: Proximal mapping, gradient descent, ...\n",
    "- Model zoo of commonly used architectures: UNet [8], Variational Network [9], MoDL [10], CINENet [11], ...\n",
